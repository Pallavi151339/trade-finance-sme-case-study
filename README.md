A comprehensive case study and product blueprint for building a digital **Trade Finance platform for SMEs**. This project was created as part of my product management portfolio to showcase end-to-end thinking, from user research to technical architecture and GTM strategy.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of emerging economies but face an enormous credit gap, especially in trade finance. They are often rejected due to:
- Poor access to formal credit systems
- Manual, paper-heavy application processes
- Lack of credit scoring mechanisms tailored to SMEs

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project proposes a **digital-first Trade Finance platform** that offers:
- End-to-end digital onboarding for SMEs
- Invoice financing and trade credit products
- AI-powered credit scoring engine
- Seamless integration with banks, MCA, GSTN, and credit bureaus
- Admin panel for banks/lenders to approve and disburse loans
